3 Ways to Improve Accessibility in HTML

Use Semantic HTML
:- Use appropriate tags (e.g., <header>, <main>, <article>, <footer>, <nav>) to provide clear structure and meaning to content, enabling screen readers to interpret it effectively.

Provide Text Alternatives
:- Use alt attributes for images and <track> for video captions to ensure non-visual users can access the content through assistive technologies.

Keyboard Navigation Support
 :- Ensure interactive elements like buttons, links, and forms are accessible using the keyboard (e.g., Tab, Enter, Space) by implementing proper focus management and using attributes like tabindex.
